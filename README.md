  Hello there! This is my project where I've developed a fun game using an STM32 microcontroller and a 2x16 character LCD screen. The game involves just 2 buttonsâ€”one for shooting and the other for making the character jump. Let's dive into some more details.


## Gameplay

## How to Play

The objective of the game is to achieve the highest score by maneuvering through randomly appearing blocks on the screen. You can use one button to destroy blocks and the other button to make your character jump over obstacles. Be careful though, as colliding with a block ends the game.

Before starting the game, we use a potentiometer connected to the STM32 to adjust the game's difficulty level. After setting the difficulty, the game starts, and the fun begins!
